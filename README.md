# CoffeeShop
Hello! Read below for more information about my Coffee Shop project!


PROJECT TITLE: CoffeeShop 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a virtual coffee shop ordering system for the user. The motivation behind making this project was to have something to show for the past quarter of learning and to go through the entire process of creating a full blown project like this. I wanted to sit down for some time and see what it was like trying to problem solve everyday, to use outside resources and knowing that I could have an end product at the finish line.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the program and follow all prompts given by entering your order one step at a time. When you are done ordering, you will receive a receipt outlining your entire order as well as the time at which you ordered. 


Thank you!
